We tested the Automated Object Counting pipeline on several sample images using YOLOv5l pretrained model.  

**Example: Sheep Detection**
- Input Image: `example_images/1061.jpg`
- Target Class: Sheep (class_id=18)
- Confidence Threshold: 0.5
- Output: 4 sheep detected in the image

The pipeline applies a confidence filter and outputs the total number of detected objects per image. All detection results are printed in the terminal and can optionally be saved to annotated images in the `results/` folder.
