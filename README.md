Automated Object Counting using YOLOv5

Overview
This project implements an automated object counting pipeline** using a pretrained YOLOv5 model.  
It counts objects of a specified class (e.g., sheep, cars) in images. The pipeline includes confidence filtering and can be extended to batch processing.
